borrow 100 USDT
after 2 days
borrow 100 USDT             past borrows = 100    past interest = 4        current borrows = 200
after 3 days
borrow 100 USDT             past borrows = 200    past interest = 4 + 12   current borrows = 300
after 4 days

Now on the 9th day user have to pay 300 USDT
on the 1st 100 USDT interest = 18
on the 2nd 100 USDT interest = 14
on the 3rd 100 USDT interest = 8

total interest 40

past interest =  16               past borrows = 200
current interest = 24             current borrow = 300      current day = 4

//Test Cases 1
user returning 100 USDT thats 1/2 of past borrows and 1/3 of current borrow so he will be paying = 8 + 8 = 16

past interest =  8               past borrows = 100
current interest = 16             current borrow = 200      current day = 4

user again paying 100 USDT thats complete past borrow and half of current borrow = 8 + 8 = 16

past interest =  0               past borrows = 0
current interest = 8             current borrow = 100      current day = 4

//Test Case 2
user returning 250 USDT so the user pays past interest on 200 and current interest on 250 = 16 + 19.9

past interest =  0               past borrows = 0
current interest = 4.1             current borrow = 50      current day = 4
